        <p>
          A purse is not just a functional accessory but also an essential part
          of your overall style. However, choosing the right purse can sometimes
          feel overwhelming with so many options available. Here are some
          practical tips to help you pick the perfect purse that fits your needs
          and style.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="box-2">
        <ol>
          <li style="color: #05f8cc"><h1>Choose the Right Size</h1></li>
          <ul type="circle" width="20px">
            <li>
              The size of your purse is crucial depending on the occasion and
              what you plan to carry. For small gatherings or formal events,
              compact purses or clutches work best as they are sleek and easy to
              handle. For everyday use or work, go for larger purses that are
              spacious enough to carry essentials like your wallet, phone, keys,
              and even a notebook or laptop if needed.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li style="color: #05f8cc"><h1>Focus on Quality Material</h1></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The material of the purse determines both its durability and
              appearance. Leather purses are classic and long-lasting, making
              them a great investment. If you’re looking for something
              lightweight and casual, fabric or synthetic materials are good
              options. Always check the quality of the material to ensure your
              purse will last long and maintain its style.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li style="color: #05f8cc"><h1>Pick a Versatile Color</h1></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For everyday use, neutral colors like black, brown, or beige are
              the best choices as they match with most outfits. If you want to
              add some personality to your look, consider bold colors like red
              or patterns for special occasions or to make a fashion statement.
              A versatile purse can easily transition from day to night without
              needing to switch bags.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li style="color: #05f8cc"><h1>Consider Functionality</h1></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              While style is important, don’t forget about functionality. Make
              sure the purse has enough compartments to help keep your
              belongings organized. Zippered pockets are great for securing
              important items like your phone or money, and a well-structured
              purse ensures everything stays in place.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li style="color: #05f8cc"><h1>Match Your Personal Style</h1></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your purse should reflect your personal style. Whether you prefer
              minimalist designs, statement pieces, or trendy fashion, choose a
              purse that complements your wardrobe and makes you feel confident.
              Remember, your purse is an accessory that adds to your overall
              look, so pick one that suits your vibe.
